Web components in editor
========================

Aim
---

- Choose, insert and configure web components while editing a HTML page
- See the page as "live" as possible

Requirements
------------

- Editor action to insert a web component
- Means of choosing a web component - will evolve
- Any necessary imports added automatically to the head of the page
- Web component can be seen as it will appear
- Non-UI components may not be visible
- Can switch quickly between edit and preview
- UI and non-UI components can be seen in a suitable config view
- Changes made to web components outside the editor are saved
- Can insert components at a position
- Can insert inline components around selected areas of text
- Can insert block-level components around multiple elements


Technical
---------
- HTML editor shows whole page in an iframe - so appears as will see it
- Inject CKEditor script into the page
- If necessary, wrap body in editing div
- Start inline editor on div
- On save, take body from editor div
- On save, take head from head
- BUT scripts could have modified head or body and don't want to save all changes
- If just set src of iframe to page url, don't know what it looked like - could retrieve independently
- Poss: mark/store refs to all original head elements from text and those inserted by editor, save only those

To find child nodes of element:
tb = test-box element
Polymer.dom(tb.root).children
