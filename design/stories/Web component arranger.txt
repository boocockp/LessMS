Web component arranger
=======================

Aims
----
- User can create page by arranging components
- Component-oriented - Powerpoint rather than Word

Requirements
------------
    - Add components to page
    - Remove components from page
    - Select component
    - Save only the tags needed to define the page, not elements created by web component
    - Can view and set component properties
- Can link component inputs to other component outputs
- Design view and preview
    - Components can be nested
    - Components can be dragged around
- Have text and worksheet components
- Can have plain text pages by inserting one rich text component
- If component is resizable, can drag to set its size
- CKEditor can work inside components but can't put components into CKE
- Can put text/HTML content into components that accept it
- Can insert other elements into components that accept it
- Any arrangement can be saved easily as a component
- Can set size of iframe to different sizes with presets for devices
- Selection is outside component and has resize handles, type and id


Later
-----
- Undo/redo
- Easily save a set of components as a new component

To do
-----
- Can insert at end without selection
- Scroll inserted into view
    - Tidy up head before save


Technical
---------
- To distinguish elements to save: elements introduced by user are tagged with attribute - remove others - but if nested?

Libraries
---------

- Interact
    - Has resize, constrained, multiple targets, free-placement
    - All drop is completely freeform
    - Seems like a lot of markup and CSS

- Dragula
    - All drags snap into position in page with preview of where going
    - Drag handles
    - Simple API with option hooks
    - No resize - combine with another library?
    - No autoscroll
    - Nesting possible with special tricks
    - Active modern library

- jQuery draggable
    - Previews, drag handles, grid
    - Not really integrated

- gridstack, gridster
    - Lovely grid-based layout and resize
    - Actual content is drowned in grid wrappers or extra markup

- dragabilly
    - basic free dragging

- gridly
    - strange grid block arranger, disconcerting moves between rows like candy crush

- Greensock draggable
    - Nice smooth specialised drag
    - Not open source

- Shapeshift
    - very basic grid dragger

- GridList
    - not v intuitive gridster thing

Resizing
--------

-jQueryUI resizable
    - clean and simple
    - many options
    - have to include much jqueryUI stuff even in custom build
