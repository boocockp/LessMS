Data editing
============

Aim
---
- User can view/edit JSON data files with a form UI

Requirements
------------
- When edit a JSON file, and schema.json available, use schema editor
- When edit a JSON file, and no schema.json available, use ACE editor
- Same behaviour when create a new JSON data file

Finding schema
--------------

- Also need to be able to specify schema for a new file
- In same dir? Convenient, but mixing data and definition.  Go with this for now.
- As _schema or $schema in top-level object -  But how resolve to a file? - URL?  Convention?
  - What if want an array?  _data convention?
- As (invalid for JSON) comment in the object
- Embedded in the object
- Embedded in the file as a separate object
- $schema which can be either embedded or a $ref
- New file - need to select schema
- Maybe JSON editor shows schema selector when opened if not set
- Recently used schemas or favourites easy to find
- Give choice to edit without schema
- Could have default schema for dir

Creating schemas
----------------
- Have a JSON editor for schemas
- Can be used to define types of worksheet inputs
