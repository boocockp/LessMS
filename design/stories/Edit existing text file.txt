Edit existing text file
=======================

Aim
---

- User can easily edit one of own files and save it
- Later - preview and separate publish step

Assume
------
- A file exists
- The user exists

Requirements
------------
- Can go to editing page with target page path attached to URL
- If not signed in, see warning
- If signed in but not one of own files, see warning
- Edit view allows changes
- When Save, new version seen on web immediately
- When Save, stays in edit mode
- When Close, goes to viewing the edited file

Nice to have
------------
- See actual page if go to edit for page you cannot edit
- Can sign in and start editing
- Save does nothing if no changes
- Save button disabled if no changes

Technical
---------
- Needs to work for HTML files and plain text and image
- Edit directly from view not strictly necessary - use bookmarklet
- Plain URL must serve up HTML and JS/CSS and image and JSON exactly as used in browser
- Edit page is a standalone page with editing and saving JS and CSS
- Gets file name from its own URL
- Gets text of file by Ajax
- Displays text in editor
- Editor component that could be reused in multiple page editing environment
- HTML editor responsible for reconstructing whole page if editing only allowed on part of it
- File name needs to include user identifier - prob prefix
- Need a call to check signed in and get user details
- Need to get user details (so can see whether the file belongs to this user)
- Sign in needs to show on page
- Need a signIn and a signOut event
- Server side needs to verify Google token and look up user with the id
- Hold user details as JSON in S3 docs in private bucket
- On save, call getSignedUrl and PUT file directly
- On finish editing, send browser to the file URL (finish event from editor component handled outside)
- Editor is a component, combined with loader and saver to be file-loader-editor


Ideas
-----
- Could go to different URL if that is useful
- Good to do all in browser
- Separate URL could be browser history
- Useful to be able to go direct to edit mode from a link
- Bookmarklet to go to edit area with current page preloaded
- Separate authoriser component
- Separate storage component
- Separate concerns into different components
- Data flow:
    - page or chooser -> s3-loader.filePath
    - s3-loader.fileData -> file-editor.fileData
    - file-editor.fileData -> s3-saver.fileData
- Can you define a dom-module inline in the page? Is that useful?
- Saver needs to be attached to authoriser:
  saver.fileData -> s3-google-authoriser.fileData
  s3-google-authoriser.saveUrl -> saver.saveUrl
