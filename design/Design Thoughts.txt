Design Thoughts
===============

- Non-UI web components should still have a debugging interface to show what going on, can be turned on and off
- Web components can have a standard prop setting interface, usable in CKEditor or elsewhere, that sets properties - and reflect in attribute
- Background web components should be visible in editing view, and show their settings
- When setting property to refer to another component by id, just click on it
- Linking components - by id or nesting or in content?
- Ways to edit structured data JSON files and store in CMS

Components
----------

- Data - JSON inline in host doc
- Data - references another file
- JSON Editor from JSON Schema, with undo by saving version each time it changes

Component editing
-----------------

- Use JSON editor with JSON Schema generated from property defs
